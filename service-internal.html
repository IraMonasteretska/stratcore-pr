                                    Our translators work to the highest of standards, translating text into their native
                                    language. The translator we assign to your project will live in the country to which
                                    you are targeting your message. Our translators each have their own areas of
                                    expertise: legal, medical, technical, advertising, as well as other areas. Our
                                    ambition is to deliver high-quality translations in any and every subject area.

                                    Language is at the heart of how you communicate with your customers. This places
                                    high demands on precision and consistency in the use of language. For consistency in
                                    using your preferred terminology, style and tone, we use translation memories and
                                    glossaries that help provide quality assurance. This also makes our translation
                                    services more cost-effective â€“ you do not have to pay for words and sentences that
                                    are repeated or that have been translated previously. Stratcore is a translation
                                    agency with the craft of translation as its core. We can enable multilingual
                                    communication for you so that you can reach new markets and make your company grow.

                                    When you purchase professional translation services from Stratcore you can expect
                                    translations to be well-written, correct in style, tone and register, appropriately
                                    matching the source language. Depending on context and the nature of the project, it
                                    is especially important for the translation to retain the same feeling and create
                                    the same effect as the original source. For instance, in marketing contexts, it is
                                    an advantage to create a feeling of closeness to the reader. In legal contexts, it
                                    can at times be important to convey formality and gravitas.

                                    The cultural dimension is an important consideration, which we at Stractore take

                                <p>
                                    In the context of translation, localisation means adapting something from one
                                    language to another. Consider that your company is about to launch a product or
                                    service on the global market. It would mean that the texts about the product or the
                                    service would need to be translated and culturally adapted to different countries
                                    and even different territories within that country. When readers encounter their own
                                    native language, where all the different culturally bound elements feel familiar, a
                                    sense of trust in the product or service is created. It is important for the
                                    intended target group to continue reading and not be disturbed by aspects of the
                                    text that feel unfamiliar or difficult to understand.

                                    It is important to build on the trust and establish a connection between the product
                                    and the target audience. Localisation can include:

                                    Sometimes, brand names and/or names of products and services need to be adapted to
                                    avoid evoking undesirable associations in the new language and the target market.

                                    We will appoint a dedicated project manager with great experience of managing
                                    assignments both large and small. The project manager will then choose a translator
                                    or team of translators with the right expertise for your specific texts and
                                    documents. We would be grateful if you could provide any reference materials,
                                    glossaries, translation memories from previous translations or style rules that have
                                    been used. This guarantees that we will be able to retain the terminology and style
                                    used within your company.

                                    During the translation process itself, it is possible that our translators may have
                                    specific queries about the submitted text. These queries may be about terminology or
                                    may be requests for clarification of aspects of the text, or relate to special
                                    titles used within your company or organisation. Once the document has been
                                    translated, it is passed over to one of our proofreaders. Our proofreaders, too, are
                                    chosen because of their expertise and background so that the proofreading process
                                    will ensure that the target text is of the highest quality.

                                    to our technical department, where they will ensure that the document is ready for
                                    printing.
